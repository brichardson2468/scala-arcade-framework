    "# Event Driven Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a _framework_ that allows us to design interactive applications \n",
    "such as animations and games using our own event driven programmning system.  We will also program a classic arcade game in this system according to the specification. Once again, we will describe the framework here and what you need to do. Your goal is to implement the missing functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall system has three parts: \n",
    "- MainEventLoop : this maintains a list of _entities_ and list of _events_.\n",
    "- Entities are objects that implement the `handleEvent` method in order to handle an event e. As a result, the entity gets transformed into a new list of entities, and generates a new list of events. \n",
    "- Events are broadcast to all entities. Each event implements an `appliesTo` method that defines all entities that it can be broadcast to.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Entities \n",
    "Entities are described in the file `Entity.scala`. The main contents are reproduced below.\n",
    "- An entity has a unique integer `id`.\n",
    "- An entity __must__ implement a function called `handleEvent` that implements how an event `e` transforms an entity. As a result, the entity can be transformed into a list of zero, one or multiple entities. Also, new events can be generated in this process.\n",
    "- An entity may optionally implement a render function with a `Graphics2D` handle, or if it does not the entity is not drawn on the canvas."

    "The main event loop is the core of the system. It is what you are going to be asked to develop. It contains a trampoline or a central event loop and some utility functions. We will explain the detailed function of the main event loop later. For the time being it suffices to understand the following facts:\n",
    "- The main event loop maintains a list of current entities.\n",
    "- It maintains a list of current _unprocessed_ events.\n",
    "- It periodically takes each unprocessed event and delivers it to all the entities to which the event's `appliesTo` function returns true. \n",
    "  - It calls the corresponding `handleEvent` function of the entity with the corresponding event.\n",
    "  - It replaces the entity by the list of entities returned by the handleEvent. \n",

    "__Important__ When an entity handles an event, it is implicitly _deleted_ and transformed into a set of new entities. The figure shows an `OldEntity` handling an event and transforming itself into three new entities. However, it may be the case that an entity changes into $0$ new entities: which is how an entity is stopped.\n",
    "An entity may change into one new entity. Or sometimes the new entity may simply be the old entity unchanged. All of these patterns are going to be useful in our event driven programming framework."
